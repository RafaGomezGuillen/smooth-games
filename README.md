# Smooth Games
## Smooth Match 3

Smooth Match 3 is a game based on match 3 games puzzles. I create this webpage just for fun, not monetary purposes, obviously any kind of donation is great for me, but you are not forced to.

Smooth Match 3 design is inspired on [Wordle](https://lapalabradeldia.com/), I like the design of that page and adapted it to this page. I wanted to try a minimalist desing as well as the Worlde game.

The whole code is not made for me, I would like to thank [Rembound](https://github.com/rembound) for his match 3 game code on Github. I added some functions such as moves *left, countdown, high score, etc...* But I want to emphasize that the whole merit is for Rembound.

## Smooth 2048

It is the same as Smooth match 3... I love 2048 games and just decided to add it on my page as well. 

The whole code is not made for me, I would like to thank [Alok Menghrajani](https://github.com/alokmenghrajani) for his 2048 game code on Github. I added some functions such as *Set undos.* But I want to emphasize that the whole merit is
for Alok Menghrajani.

## Smooth Tetris

Smooth Tetris is based on the classic tetris version. 

The whole code is not made for me, I would like to thank [Michael Karén](https://github.com/melcor76) for his tetris game code on Github. I added some functions such as *Set level, the buttons for mobile version and redesign the whole game*. But I want to emphasize that the whole merit is for Michael Karén.
