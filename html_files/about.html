      Smooth Match 3 is a game based on match 3 games puzzles. I create this webpage just for fun, not monetary purposes,
      obviously any kind of donation is great for me, but you are not forced to. <br><br>
      
      Smooth Match 3 design is inspired on <a href="https://lapalabradeldia.com/">Wordle</a>, I like the design of that page
      and adapted it to this page. I wanted to try a minimalist desing as well as the Worlde game. <br><br>

      The whole code is not made for me, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/rembound">Rembound</a> for his match 3 game code on
      Github. I added some functions such as moves left, countdown, high score, etc... But I want to emphasize that the whole merit is for Rembound.
