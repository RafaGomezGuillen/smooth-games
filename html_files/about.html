    <h1> Smooth Match 3</h1>
    <p>
      Smooth Match 3 is a game based on match 3 games puzzles. I create this webpage just for fun, not monetary purposes,
      obviously any kind of donation is great for me, but you are not forced to. <br><br>
      
      Smooth Match 3 design is inspired on <a href="https://lapalabradeldia.com/">Wordle</a>, I like the design of that page
      and adapted it to this page. I wanted to try a minimalist desing as well as the Worlde game. <br><br>

      The whole code is not made for me, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/rembound">Rembound</a> for his match 3 game code on
      Github. I added some functions such as <strong>moves left, countdown, high score, etc...</strong>  But I want to emphasize that the whole merit is for Rembound.
    </p>
    <h1> Smooth 2048</h1>
    <p>
      Then we have Smooth 2048. It is the same as Smooth match 3... I love 2048 games and just decided to add it on my page as well. <br><br>

      The whole code is not made for me, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/alokmenghrajani">Alok Menghrajani</a> for his 2048 game code on
      Github. I added some functions such as <strong>Set undos.</strong> But I want to emphasize that the whole merit is for Alok Menghrajani.

    <h1> Data and privacy </h1>
    <p>
      Game data is saved locally using localgroup Javascript function on the device where you play. I do not save any kind of personal information. <br><br>

      You are free to do whatever you want with this page.
